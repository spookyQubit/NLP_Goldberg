## From Linear Models to Multi-layer Perceptrons (Chapter 3)
   * Instead of going for the kernel trick, where the user has to pick the non-linear transformation before hand based on experience, one can have a different approach and define a trainable nonlinear mapping function, and train it in conjunction with the linear classifier. This is exactly what a NN does.
